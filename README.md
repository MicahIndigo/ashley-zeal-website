## Design

### Typography

I have chosen two font-families to use for Ashley Zeal's website. The first font-family I chose [Baumans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baumans). It is a sans-serif font with an geometric, Artistic feel. I picked Baumans as the primary font I will be using for headings and buttons as it is a clean, stylish and easy-to-read font making it ideal to use for web design.  
  
The second font-family I have chosen to use is [Savate](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Savate). I chose this font to use for text like paragraphs or captions. It is also a sans-serif type font however, it has a more expressive,  cursive style whilst maintaining being easy-to-read making it ideal to use in web design.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen based off images used throughout the site and colours commonly associated with rnb and soul music, (two genre's of music Ashley Zeal is known for).

I have also used [Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ "Contrast Grid") to help decide a visually appealing combination.

### Images/video

Ashley Zeal has provided images and videos he would like to include on the website. The images has a mix of professional studio shots and performace shots. The video is a performance of Ashley singing at an event.

### Audio

I will embed spotify player into the discography page where users are able to play Ashley Zeal's music and also be invited to follow him on spotify and/or copy song links.

### Responsiveness

Ashley Zeal's website will be responsive to different screen sizes depending what device the user is viewing the site on. This will allow users to view site as intended. I will use CSS media queries to achieve this and I will use breakpoints from Bootstrap (See image below).
